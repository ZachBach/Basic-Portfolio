    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>Hello!! Thank you for viewing my portfolio! My name is Zachary Auerbach,i am from the San Fernando Valley in sunny California.
        I am currently on my dream path of becoming a Mern fullstack software developer.Since you are still reading this i bet you are curious as to why it is my dream?
        In a world that runs off of technology that is constantly changing, its only logical no? Coding truly astonishes me and has peaked my interest latley. We use our phones, and laptops , and tablets every day in numerous ways. Throughout our day we are using it for everything from business to private matters.
        Since we use it every day of our lives, wouldn't you too want to know the backbone that lets us use these websites and applications?
        Understanding how it works is one thing, building applications and websites is now my lifelong dream. That is why it fascinates me so much! It is constantly changing and evolving. I want to evolve and change with it, into the best software developer and beyond!!</p>
