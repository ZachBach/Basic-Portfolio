    <p1>Hello!! Thank you for viewing my portfolio! My name is Zachary Auerbach,i am from the San Fernando Valley in sunny California.</p1>
    <p2>I am currently on my dream path of becoming a Mern fullstack software developer.Since you are still reading this i bet you are curious as to why it is my dream?</p2>
    <p3>In a world that runs off of technology that is constantly changing, its only logical no? Coding truly astonishes me and has peaked my interest latley. We use our phones, and laptops , and tablets every day in numerous ways. Throughout our day we are using it for everything from business to private matters.</p3>
    <p4>Since we use it every day of our lives, wouldn't you too want to know the backbone that lets us use these websites and applications?</p4>
    <p5>Understanding how it works is one thing, building applications and websites is now my lifelong dream. That is why it fascinates me so much it is constantly changing and evolving. I want to evolve and change with it, into the best software developer and beyond!!</p5>
